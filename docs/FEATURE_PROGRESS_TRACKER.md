# Xuân Tôi — Feature Progress Tracker

## Purpose

File này dùng để theo dõi các chức năng cần phát triển/hoàn thiện. AI/dev sau mỗi PR phải cập nhật file này để người sau biết việc gì đã xong và việc gì làm tiếp.

## Update Rules

- Cập nhật file này trong mọi PR có thay đổi feature, UX, gameplay, test, smoke, admin, liveops hoặc docs roadmap.
- Khi bắt đầu làm PR: đổi task từ TODO sang IN_PROGRESS.
- Khi PR xong/merged: đổi task sang DONE, ghi PR number/branch/commit nếu biết.
- Nếu task hoàn thành một phần (hết scope PR nhưng còn task con chưa xong): đổi sang PARTIAL, liệt kê phần còn lại trong Done Criteria hoặc Note.
- Nếu không làm được: đổi sang BLOCKED và ghi lý do.
- Nếu task không nên làm nữa: đổi sang DEFERRED và ghi lý do.
- Sau khi hoàn thành một task, chọn task TODO ưu tiên cao nhất tiếp theo.
- Không xóa task cũ; chỉ chuyển xuống phần Completed nếu quá dài.

## Priority Queue

| Rank | Task / PR | Status | Why It Matters | Scope | Main Files / Modules | Done Criteria | Last Updated |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Daily Loop First Session Polish | DONE | New players need a clear first-session path; this is the highest-impact beta polish. | Improve priority, copy, reward hints, completion states, and CTAs on home/daily loop. | `DailyLoopPanel.vue`, `HomeView.vue`, `NextActionPanel.vue`, optional `player-dashboard` | Fresh character sees 3-5 best actions with route, state, and reward hint; completed actions de-prioritized. | 2026-05-19 |
| 2 | Equipment Flow Cleanup | DONE | Equipment is core progression, but the current path is split across inventory/equipment/upgrade surfaces. | Make equip/unequip/upgrade entry points coherent. | `EquipmentView.vue`, `InventoryView.vue`, `EquipmentUpgradePanel.vue`, `apps/web/src/api/inventory.ts` | Player can understand equipped slots, available gear, unequip, and upgrade route from one flow. | 2026-05-19 |
| 3 | Core Loop Smoke Proof Pack | DONE | Beta needs proof that the core progression loop works end-to-end. | Add positive smoke for breakthrough success and mission claim; optionally spiritual-root reroll if seed exists. | `scripts/smoke-*.mjs`, `breakthrough`, `mission`, `admin`, docs checklist | Smoke passes for breakthrough success and mission claim with no duplicate reward. | 2026-05-19 |
| 4 | Combat Entry Consolidation | DONE | Combat has several entry routes and can confuse players. | Route players from combat hub to the best available combat action. | `CombatHubView.vue`, `DungeonView.vue`, `DungeonRunView.vue`, router | One obvious combat CTA for fresh and returning players; no broken route loops. | 2026-05-19 |
| 5 | Quest/Mission/Story Labeling Polish | DONE | Players need to understand mission vs quest vs story progression. | Clarify labels, tabs, status, and CTAs. | `QuestView.vue`, `MissionView.vue`, `StoryV2View.vue`, i18n | Each surface explains its role through labels and status without long tutorial text. | 2026-05-19 |
| 6 | Boss Notification Integration | DONE | Active bosses are strong daily-return content but need visibility. | Wire active boss cues into notifications/daily loop where backend supports it. | `boss`, `notification`, `web-push`, `DailyLoopPanel.vue` | Active boss appears in daily loop/notification with correct route and safe fallback. | 2026-05-19 |
| 7 | Party Membership / Invite Polish | DONE | Party/co-op systems exist but need clearer social entry. | Improve create/invite/member state and co-op entry gating. | `party`, `PartyHubView.vue`, `PartyPanel.vue` | Player can create/join/invite or understand why unavailable; co-op routes respect party state. | 2026-05-19 |
| 8 | Admin Reload Guard Fix | DONE | Admin direct reload is a known UX bug for beta operators. | Ensure auth hydrate finishes before admin role redirect. | `AdminControlCenterView.vue`, auth store/router guard | Direct reload of `/admin/control-center` works for admin and still blocks non-admin. | 2026-05-19 |
| 9 | Beta Checklist Refresh | DONE | Current beta docs are partially stale versus code. | Sync beta/QA docs with current code and tracker. | `docs/BETA_CHECKLIST.md`, `docs/QA_CHECKLIST.md`, `docs/FEATURE_AUDIT_AND_ROADMAP.md`, this file | Checklist reflects current DONE/PARTIAL/DEFERRED state and next smoke gaps. | 2026-05-19 |
| 10 | Mobile Top Routes QA Pass | DONE | Closed beta users are likely mobile-heavy. | QA top routes on mobile and fix obvious layout blockers. | App shell, `/home`, `/combat`, `/equipment`, `/missions`, `/inventory`, `/mail`, `/admin` | Top routes are usable at common mobile widths; issues documented or fixed. | 2026-05-19 |
| 11 | Production Ops Polish | DONE | Ops infra exists but restore drill, operator runbook, and drill tracking gaps remain. | Restore drill script, runbook enhancement, drill log, smoke integration. | `scripts/restore-drill.mjs`, `docs/RUNBOOK.md`, `docs/BACKUP_RESTORE.md`, `scripts/smoke-all.mjs` | Restore drill passes end-to-end; runbook has drill procedure + pre-deploy checklist; drill log template exists. | 2026-05-19 |
| 12 | Market V2 Player UX Polish | DONE | Market V2 (Auction House + Claim Box) is functional but utilitarian — raw table layout, no time remaining, no status badges. | Card layout, time remaining, status badges, role hint, cross-nav, better empty states, i18n keys. | `MarketV2View.vue`, `vi.json`, `en.json`, `MarketV2View.test.ts` | Card layout with time remaining + status badges; role hint + cross-nav; claim box with source descriptions; 7/7 tests pass. | 2026-05-19 |

Market: post + buy + cancel + anti-FE-self-grant. | `scripts/smoke-sect-positive.mjs`, `scripts/smoke-market-positive.mjs`, `smoke-all.mjs`, `package.json` | Both scripts pass with 0 failures; anti-FE-self-grant invariants verified; added to smoke-all as opt-in. | 2026-05-19 |

| 42 | Playwright E2E Full-Stack Gate — Specs #23–#25 | DONE | Playwright golden path has 22 specs but only spec #1 runs in CI. 3 high-value flows lack E2E coverage: sect boss fight, market V2 auction post/bid, and daily quest reset. | Sub-gap 1: Add golden.spec.ts spec #23 (sect boss spawn→fight→claim). Sub-gap 2: Add spec #24 (market V2 post→bid→finalize). Sub-gap 3: Add spec #25 (daily quest reset after window expiry). Sub-gap 4: Wire E2E_FULL gate in CI for these 3 specs (deferred — separate infra PR). | `apps/web/e2e/golden.spec.ts`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | 3 new E2E specs added; specs pass with E2E_FULL=1; typecheck + build pass.

QA-003: Create `scripts/smoke-flush-rate-limits.mjs` to flush all rate-limit Redis keys, wire as `pnpm smoke:flush-rate-limits`. Update docs to move both issues to Resolved. | `scripts/smoke-flush-rate-limits.mjs`, `package.json`, `docs/AI_HANDOFF_REPORT.md`, `docs/FEATURE_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md` | QA-004 already fixed (await hydrate line 237 + 5 tests).

**Next: Beta Readiness — Smoke Expansion Pack. DONE.** Default suite expanded from 14→24 scripts. 4 new scripts (alchemy, gem, refine, pet) added with positive paths.

**Post-Beta Test Coverage + Placeholder Wire Pack. DONE.** 4 PRs closing service test gaps + returner wire:
- PR 1: Monetization Service Test Coverage (8 services, 50 tests) — DONE
- PR 2: Pet Service Test Coverage (7 services, already covered by existing tests) — DONE
- PR 3: Market-V2 Tests + Returner Wire (existing tests + `returner.onLogin()` wired in auth.service.ts) — DONE
- PR 4: Admin-CC + Event-Builder Tests (4 services, 29 tests) — DONE

**Code Review Hardening. DONE.** PR #702 — 17 issues fixed across 20 source files + 6 docs:
- Cross-guard ACTIVE state: Combat↔DungeonRun↔Boss↔Roguelike bidirectional
- Unified daily limit: count Encounter + DungeonRun from both tables
- Encounter update moved INSIDE transaction
- Combat/Boss reward cap via RewardCapService
- Alchemy rate limiter (60 req/min)
- Talent defense + pet bonus parity
- Boss HP negative clamp, Market V2 audit trail, Cultivation pagination, Seeded RNG

**Next recommended:** Run `pnpm smoke:all` against local stack to verify all suites pass. Then proceed to beta launch checklist.
